## 1. Monitoring Strategy

### Primary Observability Tools

| Concern | Tool | Rationale |
| ------- | ---- | --------- |
| Error tracking | [e.g. Sentry, Datadog, Bugsnag] | [Why] |
| Infrastructure metrics | [e.g. CloudWatch, Grafana, Datadog] | [Why] |
| Log aggregation | [e.g. CloudWatch Logs, Loki, ELK] | [Why] |

### Cost Boundary Management

- [Set a monthly spend cap or alert threshold.]
- [Free-tier limits used during MVP.]

## 2. Log Aggregation Approach

- **Structured logging:** all application logs use JSON with consistent fields (`timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `requestId`, `service`, `environment`).
- **Log levels:** `ERROR` for actionable failures, `WARN` for degraded states, `INFO` for business events, `DEBUG` for development.
- **Retention:** [e.g. 14 days for application logs, 30 days for infrastructure logs.]

## 3. Distributed Tracing

- **Tracing tool:** [same as error tracking or a dedicated APM — link the ADR.]
- **Trace propagation:** [how trace IDs flow across services / across frontend and backend.]
- **Sampling strategy:** [full in dev/staging, adaptive or head-based in production.]

## 4. Key Metrics and Dashboards

### Service-Level Indicators (SLIs)

| SLI | What it measures | Target | Source |
| --- | --------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Error rate | % of 5xx responses out of total requests | < 1% | [Tool] |
| p95 latency | 95th percentile response time | < [N]ms | [Tool] |
| Availability | Successful requests / total requests | > 99.5% | [Tool] |

### Dashboard Views

| Dashboard | Audience | Panels |
| --------- | -------- | ------ |
| Application Health | Dev team | Error rate, p50/p95 latency, request volume by route |
| Infrastructure | DevOps / Infra | CPU, memory, connections, disk, network |
| Business KPIs | Product | [Key conversion or usage metrics] |

### Dashboard Mockups

> ASCII mockups or exported screenshots can be committed here to anchor conversations before dashboards are built.

│  │ Error Rate    │ │ p95 Latency   │ │ Request Vol   │  │
│  │   0.3% ✓     │ │   89ms ✓      │ │   1.2k/min ✓  │  │
│  └───────────────┘ └───────────────┘ └───────────────┘  │

## 5. Alerting Rules and Escalation

| Condition | Severity | Action | Notification |
| --------- | -------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Error rate > 2% for 5 min | Critical | Page on-call | [Channel] |
| p95 latency > 500ms for 10 min | Warning | Slack notification | [Channel] |
| Disk usage > 80% | Warning | Review + plan | [Channel] |

### Escalation Flow

1. Alert fires → notification to [channel]
2. Acknowledged within [N] minutes → investigation begins
3. Not acknowledged → escalate to [secondary contact]
4. Resolved → post-incident review if severity is Critical

## 6. Performance Monitoring

- **Frontend:** [Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS), error boundary reports, bundle size tracking.]
- **Backend:** [Endpoint latency distributions, slow query logging, connection pool stats.]
- **Database:** [Query performance, index usage, connection count.]

## 7. Observability Integration in Delivery Workflow

- Release tagging in the error tracker is triggered by the production deploy pipeline.
- Every PR includes a link to related Sentry/error-tracker issues when available.
- Monitoring dashboards are reviewed during sprint planning or release sign-off.

## 8. Data Privacy and Security in Observability

- PII is scrubbed before ingestion (field redaction rules in the error tracker).
- Log aggregation does not store raw request/response bodies by default.
- Access to observability dashboards follows the same RBAC model as the application.
- Audit trails for infrastructure changes are captured separately (IaC plan/apply logs).

## 9. Cost Management

- [Monthly review of observability spend.]
- [Free-tier limits documented per tool.]
- [Actions taken when approaching limits: sampling adjustments, retention reduction.]
