# F-000 Feature Template

> **This file is a template, not a feature.** To define a new feature, copy this file to
> `f-XXX-short-slug.md` (next free ID from the [Feature Map](./README.md#feature-map)),
> fill in every bracketed placeholder, and register the feature in the Feature Map.

| Attribute        | Value                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Project**      | [Project Name]              |
| **Version**      | 0.1                         |
| **Status**       | Draft                       |
| **Readiness**    | Draft                       |
| **Owner**        | Product Owner               |

## Context

- **Problem**: [The user problem this feature solves, in one sentence.]
- **Primary Persona**: [Persona from [user-personas.md](../00-context/user-personas.md) who benefits most.]
- **In Scope**: [Comma-separated list of capabilities included.]
- **Out of Scope**: [Comma-separated list of explicitly excluded capabilities.]

## Functional Requirements

> Use IDs `FR-XXX-NN` where `XXX` matches the feature number. Every requirement needs
> testable acceptance criteria. Reference open-question IDs (`Q-xxx`) in the
> traceability column when a requirement resolves a question.

| ID        | Requirement                                                        | Source               | Priority | Owner (DRI)   | Decision Traceability (Q-ID) | Acceptance Criteria                                                        | Status    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| FR-000-01 | [The system allows …]                                              | Overview             | Must     | Product Owner | —                            | [Observable, testable outcome.]                                            | Draft     |
| FR-000-02 | [The system allows …]                                              | Open Questions Q-xxx | Must     | Product Owner | Q-xxx                        | [Observable, testable outcome.]                                            | Draft     |

## Feature-Scoped Non-Functional Requirements

> Use IDs `NFR-XXX-NN`. Cross-cutting NFRs belong in the
> [README quality baseline](./README.md#cross-cutting-quality-baseline) instead.

| ID         | Requirement                                                        | Metric / Target                                                                 | Priority | Owner (DRI) | Decision Traceability (Q-ID) | Status    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- | --------- |
| NFR-000-01 | [Quality requirement scoped to this feature.]                      | [Measurable target; reference cross-cutting NFR-Xnn where applicable.]          | Must     | Tech Lead   | —                            | Draft     |
